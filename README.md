# Useful Custom React Hooks

A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features and these custom hooks saves lots of time by performing specific tasks.

#### useToogle 
- It works just the same as useState returns a value and toggleValue function.
- toggleValue function gives toggledValue if the value passed is a boolean.

#### useTimeout
- It sets the timeout, works the same as setTimeout.
- It gives the reset and clear function, works without it too.
